a lightweight, webcam-powered Python script that transforms SolidWorks into an intuitive, touch-free design environment. By leveraging MediaPipe's real-time hand tracking and the pySW library (a Python wrapper for the SolidWorks COM API), it enables engineers to manipulate 3D models using natural gestures via your laptop's front-facing webcam. The MVP focuses on core viewport navigation—orbits, pans, and zooms—without the need for a compiled .NET add-in or inter-process communication. Everything runs in a single Python process for minimal latency (~10-20ms end-to-end) and easy setup: just pip install pySW mediapipe opencv-python pywin32 and launch as a macro or external script.
Activation
Run the script from SolidWorks' macro toolbar (Tools > Macro > Run) or externally via command line. Grant camera access once on startup, and it idles passively in the background, monitoring the webcam feed. Use a hotkey (e.g., Ctrl+G) to toggle on/off—hands enter the frame to activate gestures dynamically.
User Interaction Flow
The system processes your webcam feed at 640x480 @ 30fps. MediaPipe detects up to two hands, extracting 21 landmarks per hand for precise tracking. Gestures trigger only on a "pinch" (thumb-to-index distance < 5% of hand width, tunable via config file). Hand translations map directly to viewport commands in real-time, based on pixel deltas per frame (scaled by a sensitivity slider in settings). pySW dispatches these to SolidWorks' IModelView interface for seamless updates—no serialization or queuing overhead. Exit any gesture by releasing the pinch; the system resets to idle.
Single-Hand Rotation (Orbit Mode)
Activation: Raise one hand into frame and close thumb-to-index for a steady pinch.
Manipulation: Translate your pinched hand left/right/up/down across the screen. The model orbits fluidly around its center: horizontal swipes induce yaw (rotate side-to-side), vertical ones pitch (up/down tilt). Speed scales with hand velocity (e.g., slow drag for fine tweaks, quick flick for broad spins). Diagonal moves decompose into combined yaw/pitch via vector math. Under the hood: pySW calls model_view.RotateAboutCenter(x_angle, y_angle) with angles derived from scaled deltas, followed by GraphicsRedraw2() for instant feedback.
Dual-Hand Translation & Zoom (Pan/Scale Mode)
Activation: When two hands are detected and both perform a pinch gesture, enter translate and zoom mode.
Translation (Parallel Move): Keep hands pinched at consistent width and move them together in unison—horizontal/vertical/diagonal drags pan the entire viewport (model slides without rotating). Ideal for recentering on a sub-assembly. Adjusts based on average hand speed for smooth tracking. pySW implementation: model_view.Translate(dx, dy) using averaged position deltas.
Zoom (Spread/Contract): While pinched, vary hand width—spread apart to zoom in (enlarges details), contract together to zoom out (model shrinks, revealing context). Width change rate dictates speed: slow spread for gradual reveal, fast for quick overviews. Capped at 10x zoom to match SolidWorks limits. pySW: model_view.Zoom(factor) computed from width delta ratio, with bounds checking.
Technical Highlights

Streamlined Architecture: All-in-Python stack (MediaPipe → Gesture Engine → pySW API calls) eliminates legacy IPC and .NET layers, reducing setup to a single script.
Customization: Sensitivity, pinch threshold, and velocity scaling editable in a JSON config. Extendable for future gestures (e.g., swipe for section views) via pySW's full COM access.
Compatibility: SolidWorks 2020+ on Windows; tested with pySW v0.3.2 (July 2025 release). No admin rights needed beyond initial camera perms.
Performance: Handles 30fps tracking with <5% CPU on mid-range laptops; fallback to polling if COM events lag.
